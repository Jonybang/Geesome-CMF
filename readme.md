## Overview

This project largely took the concept from [MODX CMF](https://modx.com/) in admin interface and database scheme.

Due to use [aravel framework in backend - this CMF uses all its advantages and removes all restrictions of custom fraemworks (like MODX).

General entities:  
- [Page](app/Page.php) - page entity for store title, alis(uri), description, content, is_published flag and other general page info. Resources - analog of MODX;
- [Template](app/Template.php) - laravel template with path in [resources/views/templates](resources/views/templates) folder, which the used for render page with his data in {{$page}} variable. Template - analog of MODX;
- [SubField](app/SubField.php) - bind to templates for input and output sub data in pages(as images, sliders data, additional text blocks and etc.). Template Variables(TV) - analog of MODX;
- [ControllerAction](app/ControllerAction.php) - bind to templates for execute some laravel CustomController@myAction when page rendered and get data from it. Snippets - analog of MODX;
- [Setting](app/Setting.php) - some variables for change backend and fronted logic or mode. Also available in templates;
- [Dictionary](app/Dictionary.php) and [DictionaryWord](app/DictionaryWord.php) - certain general phrases, which are not related to any page or other custom entity(as 'Subscribe', 'Copyright' and etc.). Also available in templates.

Sub entites:  
- [UserActionLog](app/UserActionLog.php) - logs about users actions with all entities (create, update, delete);
